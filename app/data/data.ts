  {
    question: "How should I name my files?",
    answer:

For example: 01 SculptedAudio - My Song_V1_24b_44.1. In stem mastering, include the stem name after the track name: 01 SculptedAudio - My Song (KICKS)_V1_24b_44.1.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose stereo mastering or stem mastering?",
    answer:
      "Stereo mastering is usually the preferred method. Stem mastering is recommended only if there are issues in the mix that can’t be resolved through traditional mastering or by the mixing engineer. Note that stem mastering may alter the final mix slightly, as any mix buss processing will need to be removed. If you are not fully satisfied with your mix, we offer a free consultation to help determine the best approach for your track. If needed, we can also provide mixing services to ensure your track is in optimal shape before mastering.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your revision policy?",

      "Turnaround times vary depending on the complexity and workload. Typically, mixing and mastering are completed within 7 days. For expedited services, please inquire about availability and additional fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to provide for mixing/mastering?",
    answer:
      "Along with your audio files, please provide any relevant notes or specific instructions about your project. For mixing, include any demo mixes, self-masters, and reference tracks that align with your vision for the final sound.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make changes to my mix or master after delivery?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can request changes to your mix or master. Please note that additional revisions beyond the initial scope may incur extra charges, depending on the nature and extent of the changes.",
